This is an example [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project, demonstrating a technique where when a link is clicked, content is shown within a modal, but when the url of that link is requested, content is shown on a dedicated page.

Inspired from Leigh Halliday's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyjuRCxpf6Y).
